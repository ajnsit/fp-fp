# fp-fp
A collection of FP (mostly Haskell and Purescript) insights across all experience ranges

## Plan

1. Information will be comprehensive and crowdsourced.
2. The information will be bite-sized and heavily cross-linked. A knowledge graph.
3. There will be hubs of information which will have larger than usual number of outgoing links. These will make good starting points to consume information.
4. There will be well trodden learning-paths, akin to giving people guided tours through the vast landscape of information.

## Getting Started

1. Learn how to [Contribute](Contribute.md).
2. Start reading from our [Generic Profile Hub](Profile/Generic/Hub.md).
